### Introduction

This is a Python-based web application using the Streamlit library that retrieves stock prices and information using the Tiingo API, and displays it along with Bollinger Bands charts and stock recommendations for any S&P500 stock selected. The application allows for query parameters to be selected via a side panel and the stock ticker to be selected from a web-based text file.
